# Yesselman Group Programming Resources
This repo contains a variety of programming resources aimed at beginners. The repo's contents are divided into folders and they are as follows:
## `/general_skills`
This folder is aimed at covering a variety of general skills that aid in development/software usage. Note that these materials are designed for use with Linux/Mac, though they are likely applicable to Windows Powershell with minimal changes. Specific topics covered are: 
+ commandline `git` and `github`
+ `vim` (coming soon!)
+ shell scripts (coming soon!)
+ commandline mastery (coming soon!)
## `/python_tutorials`
This folder is aimed at covering an introduction to `python`, specifically for data science purposes. Note this is a forked repo. Specific topics covered are:
+ primitive data types
+ the container objects `list`, `dict` and `set`
+ control flow with `if`, `else` and `elif`
+ iterations with `for` and `while` loops 
+ encapsulating code with functions
+ grouping functions and variables together with classes
+ module importing
+ ensuring validity with the `unittest` module
+ file IO
+ simple string manipulation
+ the `matplotlib` and `pandas` modules
