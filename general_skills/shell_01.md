Welcome to the first shell tutorial in the Yesselman Group's general programming repo
# Part I: What is the shell? Why use it? How does it work? 
A shell is the command processor found in the terminal whose job is to take inputs and interface directly with the computer's resources to execute these instructions. There are a variety of shell programs in existence including bash, csh, zsh, dash and more. While they are all different implementations, their functionality frequently overlaps and this tutorial will focus on **bash**, the most prevalent/universally used shell. It should also be noted here that the terms shell, bash and terminal
will be used interchangeably
